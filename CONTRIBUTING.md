# Contributing

Thank you for showing an interest in contributing to Podium ❤️

You can find [the general contribution docs here](https://github.com/podium-lib/.github/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md).

This module is a [shared config for ESLint](https://eslint.org/docs/latest/extend/shareable-configs). We accept changes that should apply to all repositories in the [podium-lib origanisation](https://github.com/podium-lib).

A change in configuration is considered a `patch` in [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/). A new export would be a `minor`. Updating the `peerDependency` to a higher version would be a `major`.
